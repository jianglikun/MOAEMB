we introduce MOAEMB (MOAs prediction via embedding extraction), a method that leverage embedding net and contrastive learning trans-form the signatures with same MOAs into similarity d-dimensional vector of latent feature. In signature embedding space same MOAs are close together and the different are far apart. We evaluate the accura-cy of signature matching with MOAEMB on different TAS data as well as individual cell lines. After compared with several statistical and machine learning techniques, find MOAEMB has a substantial im-provement.
